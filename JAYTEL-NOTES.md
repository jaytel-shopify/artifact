Still to implement:

- simple search for projects
- nicer card thumbnails for projects. that dynamically pull in actual frames of videos and screenshots of iframes. not just icons

- on project view, add stacking of collections for artifacts
- jespers help to make drag and drop and stacking collections interaction nicer

- logo design by mclane or melike or marv

- page renaming, smoother input field transition when doubleclicking

- FIGMA SUPPORT. think through this one

- mobile responsiveness

- drag projects into folders

- more breakpoint options for URL embeds
- or custom breakpoint option
- hitting ENTER after pasting in a URL should submit the URL

- live follow mode feature

- delete PDF artifacts

- fit height feature
