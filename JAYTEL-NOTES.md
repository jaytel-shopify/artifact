Still to implement:

- simple search for projects
- nicer card thumbnail

- on project view, add stacking of collections for artifacts
- jespers help to make drag and drop and stacking collections interaction nicer

- logo design by mclane or melike or marv

- loading transitions, nice soft fades into pages so not so jumpy

- page renaming, smoother input field transition when doubleclicking


- FIGMA SUPPORT. think through this one

- mobile responsiveness

- drag projects into folders

- add iframe indicator, and an 'open link' button for URL artifacts
- more breakpoint options for URL embeds
- or custom breakpoint option
- hitting ENTER after pasting in a URL should submit the URL

- change video defaults to be looping with no controls

- live follow mode feature
